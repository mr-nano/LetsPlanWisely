# Task Flow Visualizer

This project provides a web-based application to define and visualize task dependencies and scheduling using a simple Markdown-like input format. It features a CodeMirror editor for input, real-time parsing and linting, and a Konva.js-powered canvas for dynamic visualization of the task schedule.

## Features

### Implemented

  - **CodeMirror Editor:** An interactive text editor based on CodeMirror 6 for entering task definitions.
      - **Syntax Highlighting:** Basic syntax highlighting for the custom Markdown-like task definition language.
      - **Autocompletion:** Provides autocompletion suggestions for existing task names, assisting with dependency definition.
      - **Linting & Error Display:** Real-time feedback on syntax errors and warnings from the parser and scheduler, with visual indicators in the editor's gutter and detailed messages below the editor.
      - **Dynamic Word Wrapping:** Users can toggle word wrapping on/off in the editor, providing flexibility for viewing long lines of code.
  - **Task Parsing:** Parses the custom Markdown-like input to extract tasks, their descriptions, durations, dependencies, global bandwidth, and task groups.
  - **Task Scheduling:** Implements a scheduling algorithm to arrange tasks based on their dependencies and available bandwidth, aiming to minimize overall project duration.
  - **Konva.js Visualization:**
      - Dynamically renders the scheduled tasks on a canvas, showing their start times, durations, and dependencies visually.
      - Responsive canvas that adjusts to panel size changes.
      - Basic pan and zoom functionality for navigation within the visualization.
  - **Resizable Panels:** The left (editor) and right (visualization) panels can be resized by dragging the separator.
  - **Fullscreen Mode:** Users can toggle fullscreen mode for either the editor or the visualization panel for focused work.
  - **Real-time Updates:** Changes in the Markdown input are immediately parsed, scheduled, and reflected in the visualization and error display.

### Pending Features / Known Limitations

  - **More Robust Autocompletion:**
      - Context-aware autocompletion for task attributes (e.g., suggesting 'L', 'M', 'S', 'XL' for duration labels).
      - Suggesting available task names only after "Task" or a dependency field.
  - **Advanced Scheduling Options:**
      - Support for resource allocation beyond global bandwidth (e.g., specific resource pools).
      - Handling of task priorities.
      - Ability to define custom holidays or non-working days.
  - **Improved Error Reporting:**
      - More precise error location (e.g., column numbers) for linting.
      - Suggestion of common fixes for errors.
  - **Enhanced Visualization:**
      - Visual indication of task groups.
      - Highlighting critical path tasks.
      - Filtering and sorting options for tasks in the visualization.
      - Better handling of overlapping tasks visually.
      - Print/export options for the visualization.
  - **Undo/Redo Functionality:** For the editor, leveraging CodeMirror's built-in history.
  - **Save/Load Functionality:** Save and load task definitions from local storage or file.
  - **User Interface Enhancements:**
      - Settings panel for customization (e.g., default task durations, theme).
      - Tooltips for elements in the visualization.

## Next Steps

1.  **Refine Autocompletion:** Implement more intelligent and context-aware autocompletion for the task definition language.
2.  **Improve Error Messaging:** Enhance the parsing and scheduling logic to provide more granular and helpful error messages, including exact line and column numbers where possible.
3.  **Critical Path Highlighting:** Implement logic to identify and visually highlight the critical path in the task visualization, showing the sequence of tasks that determines the project's minimum duration.
4.  **Persistent Settings:** Store user preferences like panel width and word wrap setting in `localStorage` to persist across sessions.
5.  **Performance Optimization:** For very large task sets, investigate performance bottlenecks in parsing, scheduling, and rendering, and optimize as needed.

## Installation and Setup

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

  - Node.js (LTS version recommended)
  - npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with your actual repository URL
    cd <project_directory>     # Navigate into the cloned project directory
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Or using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will start a development server, usually at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another available port). Open this URL in your web browser to access the application.

### Build for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will compile the application into the `dist/` directory, which can then be served by any static file server.
